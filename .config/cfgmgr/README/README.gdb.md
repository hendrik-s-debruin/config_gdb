gdb configuration
================================================================================

I use `gdb` a lot during debugging, mostly via `vim`'s `Termdebug` function. I
recently came across [this](https://github.com/gdbinit/gdbinit) configuration
for `gdb`. It seems to be fairly hard to find documentation about customising
your `gdb` setup. The above repository is a bit over kill for my use case
currently, but I will probably over time take some inspiration from it as I
start fleshing out my own configuration.

I track this repository using my configuration script manager available
[here](https://github.com/hendrik-s-debruin/ConfigManager)
